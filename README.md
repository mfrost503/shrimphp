#ShrimPHP#

ShrimPHP is a PHP Micro-Framework built on the idea of providing a quick 
light-weight way of getting your applications live.  ShrimPHP provides basic
routing, views, controllers, and models to give you the flexibility you need.

ShrimPHP is going to be developed using very aggressive test-driven development
tactics and the tests will be provided as part of the repository.

##Contribute##
I would love to have you contribute, but please keep in mind this is a micro
framework, the goal right now is to keep this code base running lean and mean.
Also, anything you send me should have a test with it.  If you have any questions
about testing, please let me know.  

##About This Project##
This is honestly a learning experience for me, I am not sure that this will 
appeal to anyone. I would love to get your feedback, even its something that
you will never use. I am hoping that this is a fun learning experience for me
and that I learn more and more about TDD.
